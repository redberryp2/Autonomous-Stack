# Repository for Fundamental Stacks in Autonomous Driving

This repository compiles fundamental stacks for autonomous driving implemented in C++.

## Global Path Planning

The current implementation utilizes the A* algorithm for global path planning. Global path planning is used to find the optimal path to the destination.

## Tracking

Tracking is implemented using the PurePursuit algorithm. This section ensures that the vehicle follows the path based on the current position during motion.

## Usage

Refer to the README file in each directory for specific usage and examples of each stack.

## Contribution

Contributions are always welcome! Feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests.
